AI Chatbot with MySQL Database
Interact naturally with your MySQL database via a conversational AI chatbot built using Streamlit, LangChain, and Ollama.

Features
Conversational chatbot UI built on Streamlit

Natural language to SQL query generation powered by Ollama LLM

Executes validated SQL queries safely on your MySQL database

Uses quantized LLM models for low-memory environments

Handles database connection dynamically from UI input

Graceful error handling for invalid queries or connection failures

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

MySQL or MariaDB database server

Ollama LLM server installed and running

Basic familiarity with running Python and Streamlit apps

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Raju-jettappa/AI-Chatbot-with-mysql-DB.git
cd AI-Chatbot-with-mysql-DB
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

bash
python3 -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
Install required Python packages:

bash
pip install streamlit langchain-ollama langchain-community mysql-connector-python
Install Ollama:

Download and install Ollama from https://ollama.com/download for your OS

Start Ollama server if not auto-started:

bash
ollama serve
Pull a quantized Llama3 model with reduced memory usage:

bash
ollama pull llama3-q4
Usage
Run the app using Streamlit:

bash
streamlit run main.py
Enter your MySQL database credentials in the sidebar and click Connect.

Type your questions in natural language in the chat box.

The chatbot translates your question into a validated SQL query, executes it, and returns results in natural language.

How It Works
The app connects dynamically to your database based on input credentials.

Uses LangChain with Ollama's quantized LLM (llama3-q4) to convert user queries into SQL.

Validates generated SQL queries before execution to prevent errors.

Converts SQL query results back to human-readable answers via the same LLM.

Implements session state to maintain persistent database connection across interactions.

Troubleshooting
Connection errors: Double-check database credentials and ensure MySQL is running.

Ollama memory errors: Use quantized models (like llama3-q4), or close other memory-intensive applications.

Invalid SQL generation: If the LLM cannot generate valid SQL, the app notifies you; try rephrasing your question.

Streamlit warnings: Always run the app with streamlit run main.py, not python main.py.
