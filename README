MySQL Database AI Chatbot with Ollama + LangChain + Streamlit
Interact with your own MySQL database using natural language! This project uses Streamlit for the chat UI, Ollama to run an LLM locally (with support for quantized models), and LangChain to handle prompt engineering and connection logic.

Features
Conversational Chatbot UI powered by Streamlit

Natural Language to SQL using an LLM run locally via Ollama

MySQL database connection using LangChain

Automatic SQL validation (no accidental plain-English queries sent to database)

Works on low-memory computers by using quantized models (llama3-q4)

Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mysql-ai-chatbot.git
cd mysql-ai-chatbot
2. Install Python & Create Virtual Environment
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

bash
python3 -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Python Dependencies
bash
pip install streamlit langchain-ollama langchain-community mysql-connector-python
4. Install Ollama LLM Server
Ollama lets you run open-source large language models locally on your computer.

Windows/Mac/Linux:

Visit https://ollama.com/download and download the installer for your OS.

Run the installer and start Ollama.

5. Pull a Quantized Model (Low RAM)
Recommended: Use a quantized (small footprint) version of Llama3:

bash
ollama pull llama3-q4
You can also list available models with:

bash
ollama list
Troubleshooting:
If you see a memory error, choose a smaller or quantized model (like llama3-q4 instead of full llama3).
If Ollama is not recognized as a command, ensure it's running and added to your system PATH.

6. MySQL Database
If you don’t have a database, install MySQL/MariaDB and create one:

bash
# On Ubuntu (example)
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
mysql -u root
CREATE DATABASE your_database;
Populate with sample tables as needed, or use your own.

How to Run
Start Ollama in the background (if not auto-started):

bash
ollama serve
Run the Streamlit app from your project directory:

bash
streamlit run main.py
Visit the URL provided (usually http://localhost:8501).

App Usage
Connect to Database: Enter your MySQL credentials in the sidebar (host, port, username, password, database) and click "Connect".

Ask Questions: Type your query in natural language. The app will process it using the LLM, generate SQL, execute it on your DB, and reply in conversational language.

Project Files Overview
main.py : Main Streamlit app

requirements.txt : List of Python dependencies

README.md : This documentation

Optionally: sample database SQL or schema

Advanced Configuration
Modify the model in main.py (llama3-q4) to use other models supported by Ollama if you have more memory.

Tweak LLM prompts in main.py to better fit your schema or improve SQL generation accuracy.

Troubleshooting
Common errors and solutions:

Database connection error: Double-check credentials and that your MySQL/MariaDB server is running.

Ollama memory error: Use a quantized model (e.g. llama3-q4).

LLM returning non-SQL text: The app will show a clear error. Try rephrasing your question.
